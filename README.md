### Documentation for Contributing to the SCHOOL-SYSTEM-JDBC-MYSQL Project

#### Project Overview

The **SCHOOL-SYSTEM-JDBC-MYSQL** project aims to build a multi-school management system where each school operates as an independent subsystem with its own database. However, all schools share a uniform database schema, enabling data sharing and seamless connectivity between them. The system is designed with modularity in mind, employing Java and MySQL for database operations and core functionality.

### How to Contribute

#### 1. Clone the Repository
To begin, clone the project repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prince07746/SCHOOL-SYSTEM-JDBC-MYSQL.git
cd SCHOOL-SYSTEM-JDBC-MYSQL
```

#### 2. Project Structure
Here’s an overview of the key files and directories:
- **`src/DBOperations/`**: Contains classes for database management.
  - `DBManager.java`: Core class for managing database operations.
  - `DbOperationInterface.java`: Interface defining database operations.
- **`src/SchoolCore/`**: Contains the core functionality of the school system.
  - `Courses/`: Handles course management.
  - `SchoolSystem/`: Defines and manages school entities.
  - `UserSystem/`: Manages user entities, including `Student` and `Teacher`.
- **`src/SchoolCore/Main.java`**: Entry point for running and testing the system.

#### 3. Contribution Guidelines
- Follow consistent coding styles as per the existing codebase.
- Ensure all classes adhere to modular and object-oriented principles.
- Use meaningful commit messages to describe your changes clearly.

### Quick Start for Testing Contributions

The primary entry point for contributions is the **`connectDBTechnician` method** in `DBManager.java`. This method ensures the integrity of the database, creating it if necessary, and setting up essential tables. Here’s how to use it:

1. **Set Up Database Credentials:**
   Edit the `Main.java` file to configure your MySQL credentials:
   ```java
   DBManager db = new DBManager("your_username", "your_password", "", "your_database_name");
   ```

2. **Invoke `connectDBTechnician`:**
   Uncomment the following in `Main.java`:
   ```java
   db.connectDBTechnician();
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the application from the command line or an IDE to test the database setup:
   ```bash
   java -cp .:mysql-connector-java.jar SchoolCore.Main
   ```

### Key Focus Areas for Contributions
1. **Database Management Enhancements:**
   - Improve error handling in `DBManager.java`.
   - Extend functionality for managing multiple schools.
2. **Core System Functionality:**
   - Expand `School`, `Courses`, and `User` modules.
   - Integrate features for user and course assignment.
3. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Add unit tests for critical methods, especially in `DBManager`.
   - Improve in-code comments and overall documentation.
